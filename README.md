    3. Navigate to the directory with `>cd wheel_of_fortune`.

## Code Review  

As I am learning Rust, I would hugely appreciate anyone willing to review this code. I would especially like to improve on both writing Rust idiomatically and using naming conventions that self-document the code.  

A huge thank you to [Stuart Haidon](https://github.com/Measter)
